[Speaker_1] [ 00:00 - 00:20 ] Welcome to another edition of Between Two Ferns. I'm your host, Zach Galifianakis, and my guest today is Hillary Clinton. Thank you very much, Mrs. Clinton, for being here. Critics have questions, some of your decision-making recently, and by you doing this show, I hope it finally lays that to rest.
[Speaker_0] [ 00:20 - 00:23 ] that to rest. Oh I think it it absolutely proves their case don't you?
[Speaker_1] [ 00:22 - 00:26 ] Don't you? Are you excited to be the first girl president?
[Speaker_0] [ 00:26 - 00:44 ] Well, I mean being president would be such an extraordinary honor and responsibility. But being the first woman elected president and what that would mean for our country and particularly what that would mean for, you know, not just little girls, little boys too, that's pretty special.
[Speaker_1] [ 00:44 - 01:05 ] Not to take away from the historic significance of you perhaps becoming the first female president, but for a younger, younger generation you will also become their first white president. And that's pretty neat too. As secretary, how many words per minute could you type? And how does President Obama like his coffee? Like himself?
[Speaker_0] [ 01:04 - 01:12 ] Week? You know, Zack, those are really out-of-date questions. You need to get out more. What happens if you don't get out more? You don't get out more. What happens if you don't get out more? What happens if you don't get out more? What happens if you don't get out more?
[Speaker_1] [ 01:12 - 01:17 ] What happens if you become pregnant? Are we going to be stuck with Tim Kaine for nine months? How does this work?
[Speaker_0] [ 01:16 - 01:20 ] I could send you some pamphlets that might...
[Speaker_1] [ 01:20 - 01:30 ] might help you understand. First you supported Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal and then you were against it. I think that people deserve to know are you down with TPP?
[Speaker_0] [ 01:30 - 01:34 ] I'm not down with TPP.
[Speaker_1] [ 01:33 - 01:40 ] Know what you're supposed to say? Yeah, you know me. Like the hip hop.
[Speaker_0] [ 01:39 - 01:41 ] hip-hop group. Don't tell me what to say.
[Speaker_1] [ 01:40 - 01:53 ] Fine, lose. Country goes to the shit. Let's talk about Trump. Oh, let's. When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you ever think to yourself, oh, maybe I should be more racist?
[Speaker_1] [ 01:54 - 02:02 ] When he's elected president and Kid Rock becomes Secretary of State, are you going to move to Canada? Or one of the Arctic's?
[Speaker_0] [ 02:02 - 02:04 ] I was staying in the United States.
[Speaker_1] [ 02:03 - 02:05 ] And what would you try to try to prevent?
[Speaker_0] [ 02:04 - 02:08 ] to prevent him from destroying the United States.
[Speaker_1] [ 02:08 - 02:10 ] So you're going to lead the Civil War.
[Speaker_0] [ 02:09 - 02:16 ] No, I wouldn't take up arms. I think that might be a little extreme. Oh right, because you were saying...
[Speaker_1] [ 02:15 - 02:20 ] were saying before we were rolling that you wanted to take away everyone's guns. Very cool. Cool, cool, cool.
[Speaker_0] [ 02:20 - 02:23 ] I really regret doing this.
[Speaker_1] [ 02:22 - 02:44 ] Any regrets over losing the Scott Baio boat? Not a one. So it wasn't heartbreaking that... No. Yeah, but Chauchy... I mean, who's going to be next? Max Hedrum? I'd love to meet the person who makes your pantsuits. Oh, really? Yeah, because for Halloween I wanted to go as a librarian from outer space.
[Speaker_0] [ 02:44 - 02:46 ] I think that would be a good look on you.
[Speaker_1] [ 02:45 - 02:48 ] Have you thought about what you're going to be wearing at the debates?
[Speaker_0] [ 02:48 - 03:02 ] There's this thing called the double standard, and so I think about, well, what should the first woman nominee at one of our two major parties wear to the debate? And I have no idea, so if you've got suggestions, I'm open.
[Speaker_1] [ 03:02 - 03:06 ] I'm open to them. Do you wonder what your opponent might be wearing? I mean, I assume
[Speaker_0] [ 03:06 - 03:10 ] I assume you'll wear that red power tie.
[Speaker_1] [ 03:09 - 03:12 ] tie. Or maybe like a white power tie.
[Speaker_0] [ 03:12 - 03:16 ] That's even more appropriate.
[Speaker_1] [ 03:15 - 03:22 ] When he went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melanies?
[Speaker_0] [ 03:21 - 03:34 ] I really couldn't see or hear very well, so I'm not quite sure what his vows were, but I'm sure they were great and huge and wonderful.
[Speaker_1] [ 03:33 - 03:35 ] Wonderful. Like his bowels.
[Speaker_1] [ 03:37 - 03:48 ] Chelsea, your daughter, and Ivanka Trump, Trump's daughter, are friends. Does Ivanka ever call Chelsea to talk about boys that might have crushes on her, like her dad?
[Speaker_0] [ 03:47 - 03:51 ] I don't think so.
[Speaker_1] [ 03:50 - 03:54 ] What's going to be the number one focus of your presidency?
[Speaker_0] [ 03:53 - 04:03 ] Oh, Zach, it has to be the economy. We need more good jobs with rising incomes. We've got to make the economy work for everybody, not just those at the top.
[Speaker_1] [ 04:02 - 04:07 ] We need to take a break. We just need to have a word from our sponsor.
[Speaker_2] [ 04:07 - 04:19 ] Washington is broken. The truth is too many politicians are totally controlled by special interests and lobbyists. We're going to make America great again. I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
[Speaker_1] [ 04:19 - 04:21 ] It proves the message.
[Speaker_0] [ 04:20 - 04:30 ] Why would you play a commercial for my opponent in the middle of our interview?
[Speaker_1] [ 04:29 - 04:31 ] He paid me in state.
[Speaker_0] [ 04:31 - 04:33 ] I'd be afraid to eat them.
[Speaker_1] [ 04:32 - 04:42 ] to eat them if I were you. It's a good cut of meat. I think it's part of the asshole. Well this has been A Lot of Fun Mrs. Clinton. We should stay in touch. What's the best way to reach you? Email?
